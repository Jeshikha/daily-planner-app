1. Generate HTML time blocks:

For each hour in a 24-hour period (00:00 to 23:00):
Create a time block section element
Create a sub-section element for the hour 
Set the text content of the sub-section to display the hour
Create a textarea element for appointment input
Create a button element for saving appointments
Add event listeners to the save button for saving appointments.
Append the sub-section, textarea, and button to the time block section.
Set the ID of the time block section to something like "hour-X"
Append the time block section to the container.
Repeat the above steps for each hour, creating a time block for each hour of the day.

2. Javascript

Get the current date and time using Day.js.

Get the current hour using Day.js in 24-hour format 

Get the hour associated with the time block (from its ID)
Compare the block's hour with the current hour

If the block's hour is less than the current hour:
Add the 'past' class to the block and remove 'present' and 'future'
Else if the block's hour is equal to the current hour:
Add the 'present' class to the block and remove 'past' and 'future'
Otherwise (block's hour is in the future):
Add the 'future' class to the block and remove 'past' and 'present'

Function loadAppointments():

For each time block on the page:
Get the block's ID.
Retrieve the appointment text from local storage based on the block's ID

If an appointment exists in local storage:
Populate the textarea in the block with the saved appointment text

Initialising the scheduler:

Call updateTimeBlocks() to set initial time block styles.
Call loadAppointments() to load saved appointments from local storage

When a save button is clicked:

Get the ID of the parent time block.
Get the appointment text from the sibling textarea.
If the appointment text is not empty:
Save the appointment text in local storage with the block's ID.
Display a notification by adding the 'show' class to the notification element.
Set a timeout to remove the 'show' class from the notification after 3 seconds.
